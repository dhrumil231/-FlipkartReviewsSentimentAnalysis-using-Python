üì¶ Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Python
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from Flipkart to determine the sentiment polarity of each review (positive, negative, or neutral). By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to extract insights from user feedback that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

üß† Project Objective
To build a sentiment analysis pipeline that classifies Flipkart product reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories using Python-based tools and machine learning algorithms.

‚ùì Problem Statement
How can we understand customer opinions from unstructured Flipkart product reviews and classify their sentiments to improve customer experience and product strategies?

üìä Dataset Description
‚Ä¢	Source: Public Flipkart Reviews dataset (CSV)
‚Ä¢	Features:
o	Review Text: Textual review provided by the customer
o	Rating: Numerical rating (1‚Äì5)
o	Product: Product name
‚Ä¢	Size: Varies based on source (typically thousands of rows)

üîç Approach and Methodology
1.	Data Collection and Loading
o	Imported review dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Analyzed rating distributions
o	Visualized word clouds and sentiment distribution
3.	Text Preprocessing
o	Tokenization
o	Stopword removal
o	Lemmatization
o	Removal of special characters and digits
4.	Sentiment Labeling
o	Converted numerical ratings to sentiment categories:
ÔÇß	1‚Äì2 ‚Üí Negative
ÔÇß	3 ‚Üí Neutral
ÔÇß	4‚Äì5 ‚Üí Positive
5.	Feature Extraction
o	Converted text to numerical format using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer
6.	Model Building
o	Trained multiple ML models:
ÔÇß	Logistic Regression
ÔÇß	Naive Bayes
ÔÇß	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
o	Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
7.	Model Evaluation
o	Confusion Matrix
o	Classification Report
o	Cross-validation for model comparison
8.	Visualization
o	Word clouds for positive/negative reviews
o	Bar charts and histograms for sentiment distributions
