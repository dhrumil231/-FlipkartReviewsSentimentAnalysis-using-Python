## ⭐ Project Objective & Value Proposition

The primary goal of this project is to build a reliable **sentiment analysis pipeline** that automatically classifies Flipkart product reviews.

By accurately gauging public opinion, this analysis can help businesses make **data-driven decisions** on:

  * **📈 Product Strategy:** Identifying which features or products are driving the most **positive** or **negative** feedback.
  * **🧑‍💻 Customer Experience:** Understanding core pain points that need to be addressed to improve **customer satisfaction**.
  * **📢 Marketing Insights:** Extracting key phrases and topics that contribute to overall brand perception.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Sentiment Pipeline

The project follows a standard, robust text analysis and machine learning workflow:

### 1\. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

  * **Text Normalization:** Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and tokenization.
  * **Stop Word Removal:** Eliminating common, non-informative words to focus the analysis.
  * **Lemmatization/Stemming:** Reducing words to their base or root form to standardize vocabulary.

### 2\. 🔢 Feature Engineering (Vectorization)

  * The cleaned text data is converted into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. This includes using techniques like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.

### 3\. 🧠 Machine Learning Model Implementation

  * Multiple classification models were trained and evaluated on the vectorized text features to predict sentiment:
      * **Logistic Regression**
      * **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
      * **Naive Bayes**
  * The models are evaluated using metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** to determine the best performer.

### 4\. 📈 Visualization

  * The final stage involves visualizing the sentiment distribution and trends across the dataset, offering a clear and immediate view of overall customer opinion.
